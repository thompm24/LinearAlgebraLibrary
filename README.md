  Support for basic matrix operations such as:
    Addition
    Scaling
    Multiplication
    Transposition

  In progress:
    Determinant
    Inversion
    Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    Reduced Row Echelon Form

Vector Operations:
  Support for basic vector operations such as:
    Addition
    Scaling
    Inner Product
    Outer Product

  In progress:
    Norm
    Normalisation
    Angle between 2 vectors
    Projection
    Distance between 2 vectors
    If 2 vectors are orthogonal
